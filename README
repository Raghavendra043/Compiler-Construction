Code details:

    1. dfa.py file contains the dfa simulator with all the dfa implementations

    2. scanner.py file contains functions used by dfa simulator to get input

    3. driver.py is the main function that needs to be run in the command line along 
        with a test file as argument which must reside in the tests folder.

            format of command:  python Driver.py tests/[fileName].txt
        
        The output of a test file will be present in:

                                output/output_[fileName].txt

    4. constants.py basically contains the states, token numbers and names of all tokens

    5. utils.py contains all utility functions used in different modules.



A few points related to the working of code:

    1. If at any point the dfa doesn't match any of the tokens(lexical error),
        Panic Mode Recovery is engaged and the rest of the line will be skipped.
